# Swing-Notes

## Description
This project is about (Get, Post, Put, Delete) http requests. In this project I used Axios to send http request. However in this project the client can write a note and post it, later on can update it or remove it. 
The client can search on username to see all notes. 

## OPS!!
To update the note click on the button update and write the new note, then click on the button update again. And now you can refresh the page and search to see the update :)
